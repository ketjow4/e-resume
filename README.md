# Introduction

I am a young and passionate software engineer. I specialize in Machine Learning, currently finishing a Ph.D. in that area at the Silesian Univerisity of Technology in Gliwice. My main areas of expertise are Python, Computer Vision, classical machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms.

# Work experience


**Netguru - Senior Machine Learning Engineer**

May 2023 - now

- Discovery Consultants - consulting technology-specific solutions, best tech fit for a
given problem, estimations and required team composition, software architecture,
recommended tooling, and expert calls. Meeting with clients and translating their
problems into ML projects. Handover project to the actual team and support them
in the initial phase (Since April 2022).
- Working on computer vision algorithms for tech-assisted education platform for
automatic test assessments operating in Asia and Africa.


**Netguru December - Machine Learning Engineer/Researcher**

December 2019 - April 2023

- Virtual Try-On solution for shoes, that provides extremely realistic lighting effects.
- Implementing and deploying machine learning solutions on AWS for application
intended to deepen the engagement of users participating in a training program.
- Ideation, co-organize, run Data Strategy Workshop for one of the biggest discount
retailer chain in Europe.


**Silesian University of Technology - Teaching assistant & Researcher**

October 2017 - September 2023

- Conducting research in the field of optimizing SVMs using evolutionary
algorithms. Being a part of research team in a grant project DEEVA
- Teaching assistant for numerous courses:
  -  Computer Programming - those were many courses that ranged from a freshmen year and basic programming in C/C++ up to advance C++ usage of object-oriented programming, templates, STL, design patterns and C++17/20 standards.
  -  Software Engineering - conducting laboratories which focused on basics of performance analysis and use of profilers,
  -  Introduction to compilers - 
  -  Scientific computing - 


**Future Processing - Software Engineer & Researcher**

October 2016 - November 2019

- I was part of the team that developed Sens.AI algorithm for diagnosing brain
tumors in MRI images (https://sensai.eu/en).
- I developed code for handling DICOM/Nifti data formats.
- Running experiments with U-Net architecture of deep neural nets.
- Developed the algorithm, and later deep neural network for skull stripping.
- I prepared documentation for the certification process IEC 62304 medical device
software.


**Novelty RPAS - Software Engineer**

January 2015 - September 2016

- I was responsible for building and maintaining our ground control system (GCS)
used for planning and monitoring UAV missions.
- I developed the real-time digital image stabilization algorithm to be run on UAV
using the Nvidia Jetson TK1 board.
