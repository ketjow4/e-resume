# Introduction

I am a young and passionate software engineer. I specialize in Machine Learning, currently finishing a Ph.D. in that area at the Silesian Univerisity of Technology in Gliwice. My main areas of expertise are Python, Computer Vision, classical machine learning, and evolutionary algorithms.

# Work experience


Netguru May 2023 - now
Senior Machine Learning Engineer
• Discovery Consultants - consulting technology-specific solutions, best tech fit for a
given problem, estimations and required team composition, software architecture,
recommended tooling, and expert calls. Meeting with clients and translating their
problems into ML projects. Handover project to the actual team and support them
in the initial phase (Since April 2022).
